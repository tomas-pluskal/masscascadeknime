        Fast dynamic time warping for mass spectrometry sample alignment.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Fast dynamic time warping for mass spectrometry sample alignment. The algorithm provides optimal
         or near-optimal alignments with only linear time and memory requirements, in contrast to the quadratic  
         requirements for standard DTW algorithm implementations.
