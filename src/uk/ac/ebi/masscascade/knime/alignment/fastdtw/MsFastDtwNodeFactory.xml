	<shortDescription>
		Fast dynamic time warping for mass spectrometry sample alignment.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Fast dynamic time warping for pairwise mass spectrometry sample alignment. The algorithm provides optimal
			or near-optimal alignments with only linear time and memory requirements, in contrast to the quadratic
			requirements for standard DTW algorithm implementations. The method works on the total ion chromatogram and aligns 
			the scans of the input to the reference.
			<br />
			Note that only the first row of the reference is read.
			<br />
			The node is based on a FastDTW implementation on
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fastdtw/">GoogleCode</a>
			by Stan Salvador and Philip Chan.
