	<shortDescription>
		Obiwarp feature alignment.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node calls the referenced 
			<a href="http://obi-warp.sourceforge.net/">Obiwarp</a> 
			binary with the given parameters. The reference Feature cell is taken from the first row in the reference table. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Note that only the first row of the reference is read. 
			<br />
			<br />
			The m/z and time bin width define the coarseness of the landscape. Less granular landscape are aligned faster but may yield poorer results.
			<br />
			<br />
			The second outport contains feature time shifts for every Feature cell. These are required whenever features need to be 
			mapped back to scan containers, e.g. for back-filling.
