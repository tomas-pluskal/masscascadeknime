	<shortDescription>
		Iterative node to curate annotated profiles before they are written out as generic KNIME table.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node displays the profiles of one sample after another for curation. After all samples have been curated, 
			the records are written out in generic KNIME table format. For every profile, all annotations are shown - see 
			dropdown box compounds. Only the selected compound will be written out. Redundant rows can be removed via "X". A 
			missingness value of 100% indicates that no grouping should be performed. If the value is below 100%, a profile is 
			only shown for a particular sample, if it is present in at least x% of all samples.
