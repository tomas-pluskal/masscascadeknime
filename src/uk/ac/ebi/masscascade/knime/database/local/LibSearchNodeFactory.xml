	<shortDescription>
		Spectrum-based local database search.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		    Simple MSn spectra-based local database query. The identity of reference spectra that match the query spectra 
			are added to the m/z profile in the precursor spectra. Note that if MS1 is queried, either the ion mass or exact mass 
			is used as anchor in the MS1 spectrum.
