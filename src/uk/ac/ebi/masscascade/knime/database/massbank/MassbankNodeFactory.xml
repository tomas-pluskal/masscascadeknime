	<shortDescription>
		Spectrum-based Massbank database search.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Simple spectra-based
			<a href="http://www.massbank.jp/?lang=en">Massbank</a>
			databases queries using the "spectrum search" method. The identity of reference spectra that match the query spectra
			are added to the M-H or M+H peak of the query spectra. If no M-H or M+H peak can be found, the search is assumed to 
			be invalid.

		<option name="Data column">A Spectrum data column.</option>
		<option name="Mass tolerance">A query m/z tolerance in ppm.</option>
		<option name="Score">The MassBank query score. Query results under the given score are rejected: 0-1</option>
		<option name="Min. number of profiles">A minimum number of profiles a spectrum must have to be considered for a database query.</option>
