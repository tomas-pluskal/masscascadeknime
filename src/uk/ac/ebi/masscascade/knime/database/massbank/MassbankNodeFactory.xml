	<shortDescription>
		Spectrum-based Massbank database search.	
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Queries Massbank using the "spectrum search" method. The pseudospectra are queried against Massbank one by one
			and the identity of spectra that match the query spectrum added to the M-H or M+H peak of the pseudospectrum. If no
			M-H or M+H peak can be found, the search is assumed to be invalid.</intro>

		<option name="Spectrum column">The mass spectrometry spectrum column.</option>
		<option name="Mass tolerance">The mass tolerance in ppm.</option>
		<option name="Cutoff">The relative intensity cutoff value (0-1000). Only peaks above the threshold are used.</option>
		<option name="Max results">The maximum number of results that are accepted.</option>
		<option name="Ion mode">The ion mode.</option>
		<option name="Instrument">The various instruments which spectra should be queried.</option>
