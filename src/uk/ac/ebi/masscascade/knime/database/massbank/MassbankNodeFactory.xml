	<shortDescription>
		MSn-based Massbank database search.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			MSn-based 
			<a href="http://www.massbank.jp/?lang=en">Massbank</a>
			database queries using Massbank's "spectrum search" method. The identity of reference spectra that match the query spectra (feture sets)
			are added to the M-H or M+H peak of the query spectra of precursor spectra. If no M-H or M+H peak can be found, the search is assumed to 
			be invalid. 
			<br />
			<br />
			MSn spectra must first be build using the MSn Builder node.
			<br />
			<br />
			The node relies on a web service and may be slow.
