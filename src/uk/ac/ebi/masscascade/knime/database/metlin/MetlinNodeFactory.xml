	<shortDescription>
		MSn-based Metlin database search.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		    Simple MSn spectra-based 
			<a href="http://metlin.scripps.edu/">Metlin</a> 
			database queries using the "spectrum search" method. The identity of reference spectra that match the query spectra 
			are added to the M-H or M+H peak of the precursor spectra. Note that the node only searches MS2 spectra and only takes into account 
			up to 30 high-intensity peaks.
			<br />
			<br />
			MSn spectra must first be build using the MSn Builder node.
			<br />
			<br />
			The node relies on a web service and may be slow.
