	<name>Biehman Deconvolution</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Performs Biehman deconvolution on a collection of peak profiles.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Performs deconvolution using a Bieman approach. The local maxima of a mass trace is
			perceived and, after background correction and noise estimation, deconvoluted by scanning 
			the perceived maxima forwards and backwards for local minima.
		</intro>

		<option name="Data column">A Profile Data column.</option>
		<option name="Scan window">A window used to perceive peaks from one local minimum to another [number of scans].</option>
		<option name="Noise factor">A factor by which the background noise estimation is multiplied. Peak perception terminates when
			intensity signals fall below the resulting threshold.</option>
		<option name="Center profiles">Whether profiles should be re-centerd using a three-point parabola. The actual data points are
			moved in this case.</option>
