	<shortDescription>
		Performs deconvolution (peak picking) using a modified Biemann algorithm.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Performs deconvolution using a modified Biemann approach.
			Local maxima of a feature's ion trace are detected and, after 
			background correction and noise estimation, isolated by scanning 
			the forwards and backwards for local minima.
			<br />
			Noise is estimated for every feature individually. Thus low S/N ratios of one or two can be used safely.
			<br />
			Optionally, processed features can be centered, i.e. their data points are
			centered around the apices via a three point parabola.
