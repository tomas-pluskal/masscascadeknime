	<shortDescription>
		Extracts ion chromatograms (features) using zero intensity values as boundaries between features.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Ion chromatograms (featuers) are extracted by concatenating signals in adjacent scans.
			Each successive signal of a trace must fall into the range defined by the trace's average m/z value and the m/z tolerance.
			The minimum length and intensity define the lower boundaries for a feature's length (number of successive scans) and apex intensity.
			A feature is only extracted if both boundaries are exceeded.

		<option name="Data column">MS data column.</option>
		<option name="m/z tolerance">m/z tolerance in ppm.</option>
		<option name="Min. length">Minimum acceptable length of m/z traces,
		measured in consecutive scans where the m/z signals are present.</option>
		<option name="Min. intensity">Minimum feature intensity. Feature candidates that fall below that threshold are removed.</option>
