	<shortDescription>
		Filters features using a Durbin-Watson statistic.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Uses a Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic to filter features by looking for randomness in the feature's ion trace.
			(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin-Watson">wiki</a>).
			The DW statistic can take values between 0 and infinity.
			Non-random signals typically take values below 2.
