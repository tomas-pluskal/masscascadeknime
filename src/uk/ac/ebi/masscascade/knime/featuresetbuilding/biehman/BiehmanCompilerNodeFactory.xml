	<shortDescription>
		Generates feature sets based on a modified Biemann similarity approach.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Uses a modified Biemann peak shape similarity approach to group features into compound spectra (feature sets).
			<br />
			<br />
			The algorithm relies on the peak shape and retention time of the features.
			<br />
			<br />
			The number of bins defines the granularity of the similarity measure. A single bin is defined by the given length divided 
			by the number of bins. For this method, the length should approximate the distance of two adjacent scans for fine resolution.
			Higher length values will yield larger feature sets with less similar features grouped together.
