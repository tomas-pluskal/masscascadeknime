	<shortDescription>
		Generates feature sets based on the pairwise cosine similarity between features.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Generates feature sets based on a cosine similarity matrix. Only profiles which similarity value is 
			above the threshold are grouped together.
			<br />
			<br />
			Typical values for the similarity threshold are around 0.95.
