	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Centroids scans using a continuous wavelet transform.
			<br />
			A scale of one defines five data points to be considered for convolution to the left and right of a signal.
			Higher integral values increase the window size by multiples of five.
			Scale values of one or two should be used for narrow signal shapes.
			<br />
			The width of the wavelet defines the breadth of the wavelet. 
			It takes values between 0 and 1. A width of 0.02 works well for narrow signals.
