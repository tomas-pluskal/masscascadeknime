	<shortDescription>
		Detects adducts in spectra.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Detects adducts in the feature sets and writes the information to the features.
			The node assumes the presence of either M-H (neg. mode) or M+H (pos. mode) signals as anchor points.
			<br />
			The adduct information is provided in two columns: the first containing adduct labels, the second 
			containing the exact m/z value differences, e.g. loss of water 18.010565.
