	<shortDescription>
		Detects adducts in spectra.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Detects adducts in the spectra within the given mass tolerance and writes the information to the 
			profiles. The node assumes the presence of either M-H (neg. mode) or M+H (pos. mode) signals as anchor points.
			<br />
			The adduct information is provided in two columns, the first containing the adduct label, the second 
			containing the exact adduct mass.
			<br />
			The exact adduct mass must not be corrected for charge already (i.e., addition or subtraction of a hydrogen).
