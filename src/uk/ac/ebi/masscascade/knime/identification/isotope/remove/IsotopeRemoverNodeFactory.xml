	<shortDescription>
		Deisotopes the spectra or filters the isotopes using isotope annotations.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node deisotopes the spectra by removing the isotope profiles. Alternatively, the spectra can be filtered 
			for isotopes. I.e., only profiles with isotopes are kept. In addition, all detected adducts of the major isotope peak 
			are kept as well. Isotopes can be detected using the "Isotope Finder" node.
