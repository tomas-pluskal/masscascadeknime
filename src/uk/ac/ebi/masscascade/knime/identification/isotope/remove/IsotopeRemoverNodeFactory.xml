	<shortDescription>
		Deisotopes feature sets or filters isotopes using isotope annotations.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Deisotopes feature sets by removing isotope profiles. Alternatively, the feature sets can be filtered 
			for isotopes. I.e. only profiles with isotopes are kept. In addition, all detected adducts of the major isotope peak 
			are kept as well. Isotopes can be detected using the "Isotope Finder" node.
