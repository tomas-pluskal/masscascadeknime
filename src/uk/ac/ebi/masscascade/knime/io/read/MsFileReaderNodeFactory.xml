	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node iterates over a given directory and reads the containing files.
			<br />
			PSI's
			<a href="http://www.psidev.info/mzml/">mzML</a>
			and Thermo's
			<a href="http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703">RAW</a>
			formats are supported as input formats. The File 
			Reader node supports selection of whole directories and individual 
			files. The file counter can be set to limit the 
			number of files to be read in. Broken files which cannot be parsed get 
			excluded. File names must be unique. See 
			<a href="https://github.com/SBeisken/MassCascadeKnime/wiki/FileFormats">Supported File Formats</a>
			for additional 
			information.
