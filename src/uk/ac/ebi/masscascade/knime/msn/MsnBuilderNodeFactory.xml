	<shortDescription>
		Generates representative MSn spectra.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The method compiles representative MSn spectra for each feature in the feature sets that has got MSn data attached to it.
			<br />
			<br />
			MSn data references point to the Scan containers. For each MSn level, one MSn spectrum is generated,
			only taking into account signals that are present in all MSn scans of a particular level and that are above the intensity 
			threshold.
