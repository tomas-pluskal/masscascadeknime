	<shortDescription>
		MSn builder to generate a representative MSn spectrum.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The method compiles a representative MSn spectra for each profile that has
			MSn references. The MSn references point to the RAW container. For each MSn level, one MSn spectrum is generated,
			only taking into account signals that are present in all MSn scans of a particular level and that are above the intensity 
			threshold.
