		The node annotates MSn spectra of identified profiles.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node annotates MSn spectra of identified profiles through combinatorial exploration. For every identified 
			profile with either SMILES or InChI line notation and one or many MSn spectra, the node tries to match the mass 
			signals of these spectra with fragment masses of the molecule from the line notation.
			<br />
			This node works on Windows only and requires the MSnFragExplorer executable. Only MS2 spectra acquired in positive ion mode are supported.
