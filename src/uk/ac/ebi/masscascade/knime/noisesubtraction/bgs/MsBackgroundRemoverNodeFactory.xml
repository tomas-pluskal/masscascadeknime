	<name>Background Remover</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Removes the reference background from all mass spectra.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Thoroughly removes background noise of a sample by iteratively scanning a pre-defined time window in a blank control 
			sample for noise within a pre-defined mass window.
			<br />
			The node is based on a paper by
			<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac8027189">Zhang, H., Yang, Y. (2008)</a>
			.
			<br />
			Note that only the first row of the reference table will be read.
