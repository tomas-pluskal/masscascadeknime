	<name>Background Remover</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Removes the reference background from all mass spectra.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Thoroughly removes the background of the sample by iteratively scanning a pre-defined time window in a blank control
			sample for noise for every data point in all scans within a pre-defined mass window.
