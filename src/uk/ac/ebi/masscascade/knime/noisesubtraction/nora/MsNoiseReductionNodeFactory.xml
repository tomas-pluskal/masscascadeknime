	<name>Noise Reduction</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Removes random noise from MS data cells.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Removes random noise in scans based on a minimum number of successive scans for a m/z trace. 
			For every data point in a scan, adjacent scans within the specified time window are checked for data 
			points within the mass tolerance. Only data points that are represented in adjacent scans are kept.
		</intro>

		<option name="Data Column">A MS data column.</option>
		<option name="m/z tolerance">A m/z tolerance in ppm.</option>
		<option name="Length">A minimum acceptable length of m/z traces, 
		measured in consecutive scans where the m/z signals are present.</option>
