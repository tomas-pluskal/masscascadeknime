	<name>Noise Reduction</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Removes noise from all mass spectrometry spectra.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Removes random noise in a spectrum based on a minimum number of successive scans for a m/z trace within a mass tolerance. 
			For every data point in a spectra adjacent scans within the specified time window are checked for data points within the mass tolerance. Only data points 
			that are represented in adjacent scans are kept.
