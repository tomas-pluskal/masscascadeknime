	<shortDescription>
		Morphological baseline subtraction method.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Applies the vHGW top hat algorithm for baseline subtraction.
			The node performs an opening, i.e. erosion followed by dilation
			(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology)">wiki</a>).
			Larger window widths (lengths) result in coarser baseline subtraction.
