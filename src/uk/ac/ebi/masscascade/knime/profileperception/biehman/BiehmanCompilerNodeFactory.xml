	<shortDescription>
		Node to generate pseudospectra based on a modified Biehman approach.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>The node uses a modified Biehman algorithm to group similar profiles into pseudo spectra. The algorithm relies
			on the peak shape and retention time of the profiles. </intro>

		<option name="Bins">The number of bins in the time domain.</option>
		<option name="Scan distance">The approximate distance between two successive scans (seconds).</option>
