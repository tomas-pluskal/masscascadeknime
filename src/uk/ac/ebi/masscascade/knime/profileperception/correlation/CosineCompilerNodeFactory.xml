	<shortDescription>
		Node to generate pseudospectra based on the pairwise cosine similarity between profiles.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node generates peusodespectra based on a cosine similarity matrix. Only profiles which similarity value is 
			above the threshold are grouped together.

		<option name="Bins">The number of bins in the time domain.</option>
		<option name="Similarity">The similarity threshold (cosine angle [-1,+1]).</option>
