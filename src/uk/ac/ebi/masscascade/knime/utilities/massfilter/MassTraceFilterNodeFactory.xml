	<shortDescription>
		Removes extracted profiles from the profile container using an external mass list.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Removes features from contaminants, solvents, and known impurities.
			The second inport takes a list of exact ion masses (m/z). If a feature's
			m/z value matches any of the exact ion masses within the provided m/z tolerance,
			the feature is removed.
