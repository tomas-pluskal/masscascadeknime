	<shortDescription>
		Shows cross-sample grouped features within the specified m/z and time tolerance.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Visualises profiles of similar mass that fall into identical time bins across samples.
			<br />
			<br />
			An additional integer column must be provided that contains group
			labels for the 'Missingness' option: Missingness indicates the percentage of features that
			may be absent from a feature group, i.e. missing grouped features not present in some out of all samples.
			<br />
			<br />
			The time tolerance defines the time bin width in seconds.
